        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>The Morrocan bastilla is a crunchy pie-like dish that's filled with either chicken or seafood, a vegan Morrocan doesn't exist</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>1 (5-pound) chicken</li>
            <li>8 large eggs</li>
            <li>2 cups whole blanched almonds</li>
            <li>1 pound warqa, or phyllo dough</li>
          </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Cut the chicken into pieces, discarding the skin. Add the butter and oil to a large Dutch oven or other heavy duty pot and heat on medium until the butter melts. Add the onion, and cook, stirring occasionally, until translucent, about 2 minutes. Add the spices and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the chicken pieces and stir to coat. Cover, and cook over medium to medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, for about 1 hour, or until the chicken is very tender and falls off the bone. Do not add water, and be careful not to burn the chicken or the sauce as this will ruin the dish.
            </li>
            <li>Transfer the cooked chicken to a plate, and reduce the sauce in the pot until most of the liquids have evaporated and the onions form a mass in the oil. Stir occasionally, and adjust the heat as necessary to prevent burning. Remove and discard the cinnamon sticks.</li>
            <li>While the sauce is reducing and the chicken is still warm, pick the meat off the bones, breaking it into bite-size pieces. Place in a bowl and stir in several spoonfuls of the onion mixture; cover the meat and set aside.</li>
            <li>Read Quran and it will magically become a whole dish</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
          </ol>
